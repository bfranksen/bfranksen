- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Braden Franksen. I'm in the early stages of my development career, but I am a passionate developer that loves to learn new technologies. My github profile isn't where I want it quite yet, but I am slowly filling it out.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web, app, and game development. Gaming has always been a passion of mine and I hope to join a game development team to combine my two strongest passions.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Node.js and how to publish packages to the public repository. I am looking to publish a Math related package in the near future. 
- ğŸ“« How to reach me - bfranksen93@gmail.com or https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradenfranksen/
